  .NET Core Boilerplate
</h1>

A lightweight .NET Core Class Library boilerplate, stripped to its bare minimum, powered by an optimized build system.

## ðŸ‘Ÿ Getting started

### Prepare your environment

* Download and install the latest .NET Core SDK - [.NET Core 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/README.md)

### Build and test

Start by cloning the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PulsarBlow/dotnetcore-boilerplate
```

Build

```shell
dotnet build
```

Test with coverage

> Note that the "XPlat Code Coverage" data collector friendly name cannot be changed. It is a constant name embeded inside the Coverlet data collector we use to collect code coverage.

```shell
$ dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings ./build/coverlet.runsettings -r .build/
```

### Publish package

The package publication workflow is Github Release based.

When you create a new Github release, a Github event is triggered at the repository level and caught be the Github Actions underlying system. Github actions checks if there is a workflow bound to that event and run it if it finds one.

See the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) file for more details

## ðŸŽ› Project properties

To improve maintainability of project dependencies and configuration attributes, global properties have been exported into importable *.props files:

```
./props
â”œ- package.props
â””- common.props
   â”œ- dependencies.props
   â””- version.props
```
